# DEERplot
DEERplot plots the output from however many DeerAnalysis files that you created and compare them for you and saves the PDF file. For a complete description and downloading packaged .exe file please refer to my website: <a href="http://www.spintoolbox.com/en/offline-tools/deer-plot/">spintoolbox.com</a>

** DEERplot.py and DEERplot_noGUI.py
If you want to use the UI for selecting the files and ploting them interactively, you can use DEERplot.py. The downside though is that you do not get the python code saved anywhere so that it can be changed later on or new data files can be added to it. For removing this problem I added DEERplot_noGUI.py which is essentially only the plot() function to which the filenames, colors, etc. are passed as arrays.
